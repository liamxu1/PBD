# Overview

This repository is built based on GLFW and imGui. I especially refer to the repository [EmperorJack/PositionBasedDynamics: Real-time Dynamics Simulation (github.com)](https://github.com/EmperorJack/PositionBasedDynamics), and I am trying to realize several improvements to the PBD method on this framework.



# Progress

- [x] XPBD
- [x] Continuous Material
- [x] SPH (MLS-PBD)
- [x] Projective Dynamics (Common & Chebyshev & Quasi Newton)
- [x] Improve velocity damping method

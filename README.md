# Overview

This repository is built based on GLFW and imGui. I especially refer to the repository [EmperorJack/PositionBasedDynamics: Real-time Dynamics Simulation (github.com)](https://github.com/EmperorJack/PositionBasedDynamics), and I am trying to realize several improvements to the PBD method on this framework.



# Progress

- [x] XPBD
- [ ] Continuous Material
- [ ] SPH (MLS-PBD)
- [ ] Projective Dynamics (Common & Chebyshev & Quasi Newton)
- [ ] Improve velocity damping method
